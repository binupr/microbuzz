README
======
This README points to the latest project I am working on at the moment. As I work on my home projects, only once in few months,
this README is important to be kept on track for my own benefits.

02/07/2023: 
===========
 * Revisting this folder to check where I was at last time
 * the porjects I am working on are 
    * arty-z7-hdmi : Rewrite the HDMI controller in verilog
    * arty-z7-uart : Rewrite this UART controller in system verilog

09/07/2023: 
===========
 * Progress on arty-z7-hdmi via project/arty-hdmi-graphics branch
   * Created the verilog codebase for rgb timing and pixel counter modules

30/07/2023: 
===========
 * Short Progress
  * Added code for DVI TX clock gen module

31/07/2023: 
===========
 * 1-hour weekday progress
  * Added system verilog package for functions- good learning

13/08/2023:
============
* Short 1-hour weekend progress
  * Added verilog code for oserdes & rgb_pattern modules--another good hands on learning

18/02/2024:
===========
* Coming back to home projects after 6 months.
* Project focus: arty-z7-hdmi => still on git branch arty-hdmi-graphics
  * Added verilog code for rgb_to_dvi and rst_bridge modules--good refresher and needs to do this more often
